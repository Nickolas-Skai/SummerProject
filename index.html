<h1>Project Information/ Peronal Information </h1>
<p1>Hello, my name is D'Alesseo Requena. As a student studing under the F.S.T. at the Univeristy of Belize I have decieded to embark on
    mini prjoects to build my portfolio. I am currently pursuing my Asscoicateas Degree in Information Technology. I will use this 
    medium to help my self learn HTML, CSS, JavaSpcript and some PHP.  I will try to use volentared user ideas to try to 
    make some programs and features that will be helpful for those that are willing to use it. 
    Please note that as the days go on this section of the site will change to more explicitly describe the website and its functionality. 
    if you are willing to give me some ideas to start with that would be helpful if your idea sounds doable I'll be sure to credit you after.
